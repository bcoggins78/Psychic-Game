# Psychic Game


### UNC Coding Bootcamp Week 3 Homework Project

Week 3 introduces the use of Javascript.  The project was built with:

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript


Here is how to play this game:

There will be a random letter generated at the beginning of the game. The purpose is to guess the letter the computer chose by pressing keys on the keyboard.  The player will have 9 chances to guess the correct letter.  If the correct letter is chosen, an alert will display on the screen along with an applause notifying the player of their success.  The same will happen if all chances are used up except the alert will notify the player of their loss along with an appropriate sound file.  

Things to note:
   * CSS and Bootstrap was used to shape the container to add a crystal ball theme.
   * Used JavaScript to check for duplicate keystrokes so the same key is not used multiple times.
   * Elements on the screen are updated as keystrokes are used and games are won or lost. For example, the crystal ball will turn green when a game is won, and turn red when it is lost.
